# GMTK Game Jam 2020 - Sky High

This is my submission for the "Game Makers Toolkit" yearly game jam for the 2020 year. The game jam started at 2 PM CDT on July 10th, 2020. It ended at 2 PM CDT July 12th, 2020. The theme for this year was "Out of Control".

Overall, this project was finished in about 18 hours:

- 2pm - 6pm, 8pm - 10pm on Friday
- 10:30 am 4 pm, 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm on Saturday
- 9:15 am - 1:50 pm on Sunday

My time, broken down:

- 1 hour initial scoping
- 2 hours spread around gathering assets
- rest of time spent developing

The initial scope of this project was:

- The player controls a floating city
- The player builds balloons, adds buildings into their building, and generally flies higher
- As the player goes higher, the balloons degrade quickly and eventually pop
- The player must frantically move as the game spirals "Out of Control"

## Learning

This was my first Game Jam. The most important thing I learned is scope control... 48 hours is not a long time to make a game and even trivial features that take several hours can quickly become targets for scope cut. (i.e. I had scoped several different types of resources and buildings)

It pays to have art assets prepped and ready to go before the Game Jam starts.
